## Some words

This repo contains various stuff that I got screwed in by MS. They are a big company, but only produce junk. All their software contains different types of incompleteness, or bugs, or others, that drive me nervous, crazy, and eventually pissed me off.

However, they contribute one: they made up my mind to never work with their tools, and stick to open source community backed software only.
